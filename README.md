<h1 align="Left">About</h1>
D-BAMLT is built on existing software packages used to quantify behavioral characteristics and build machine learning classifiers. Our goal is to decrease the barrier of entry in digital phenotyping to researchers, scholars, and citizen scientists trying to understand the relationship between clinical disorders and their behavioral manifestations. 


<h1 align="Left">Installation</h1>

The goal moving forward is to fully package D-BAMLT so anyone can use it. At present, you must do the following to use the program:
1. Clone this repository to your local device
2. Open python terminal
3. pip install -r requirements
4. python dbamlt.py
