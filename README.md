<h1 align="Left">About</h1>
D-BAMLT is built on existing software packages used to quantify behavioral characteristics and build machine learning classifiers. Our goal is to decrease the barrier of entry in digital phenotyping to researchers, scholars, and citizen scientists trying to understand the relationship between clinical disorders and their behavioral manifestations. 


<h1 align="Left">Getting started</h1>

Visit the [wiki](https://github.com/chags1313/D-BAMLT/wiki/)!.

<h1 align="Left">Aims</h1>

We hope this platform increases accessibility of objective and sensitive digital biomarker analysis while also encouraging the exploration and creation of novel tools for digitial phenotyping.
